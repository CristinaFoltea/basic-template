      <h4>Our Wings</h4>
      <p>Our founders first worked together developing airborne wind turbines—large rigid-wing kites that generate electricity from stronger, more consistent high-altitude winds. To guide these airborne turbines, they needed a highly accurate GPS system. When nothing on the market met their performance and cost requirements, they developed a low-cost RTK system, and Swift Navigation took off.</p>
      <h4>Our Mission</h4>
      <p>We are on a mission to enable a future of autonomous vehicles and machines to navigate and understand the world.</p>

      <h4>We’re Powering the Next Leap Forward</h4>
      <p>Swift Navigation powers the next leap forward in centimeter-level positioning accuracy with unmatched affordability and openness.</p>
      <p>Swift real-time kinematics (RTK) technology is based on open source software—the first of its kind. Open source solutions offer unprecedented flexibility to customize positioning applications and capabilities and avoid monolithic “black box” systems that restrict innovation.</p>
      <p>We also participate in the open source community, making our documentation, specifications and support available freely online. As a result, Swift RTK solutions deliver an order-of-magnitude higher precision at a fraction of the cost of traditional GPS solutions. With customers around the world, Swift is already at work navigating an automated future in UAV, robotics, survey, control, agriculture and other industries.</p>
