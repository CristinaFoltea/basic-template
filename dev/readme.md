# Developer Environment

This environment is setup to make for extremely fast and easy development of modules. This allows for the use of jade/sass.

This directory will be compiled with gulp into a 'test' directory containing a single index.html containing all of the components. All assets will Simultaneously be built into the established /web/ directory for deployment.


## Compiling  

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ gulp
```  

## Launch Live reload/browser preview and local server of the test directory.
Must run standard gulp build first.

```
$ gulp watch
```
